# 💼 Business Purpose

This demo addresses a key challenge in life insurance underwriting: the time-consuming process of reviewing lengthy applications and related documentation. By combining Amazon Bedrock's capabilities with advanced AI models, the solution helps underwriters:

- 🚀 Reduce time spent on manual document review
- 📊 Automatically extract and organize relevant information from complex documents
- 🔍 Surface key insights and potential risk factors
- 💬 Enable natural language interaction with document contents
- ✅ Increase consistency in information extraction
- 🎯 Allow underwriters to focus on decision-making rather than information gathering

# ✨ Key Features

## 📄 Document Analysis
- Page-by-page analysis of insurance applications and supporting documents
- Efficient batch processing of multiple pages at a time to optimize performance and resource usage
- Intelligent extraction of key data points from each page, enabling comprehensive analysis without token limitations
- Automatic classification of document sections with useful bookmarks

## 📁 Sample Documents

We have included sample PDF documents in the `sample_documents/` folder. These can be used to test the application's document processing capabilities:
- `life_submission.pdf`: A sample life insurance application.
- `p&c_submission.pdf`: A sample property & casualty insurance application.

# 🚀 Deployment

The project is designed to be deployed on AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for a seamless deployment of both backend and frontend services along with all necessary AWS infrastructure.

## ✅ Prerequisites for Deployment

- **🐳 Docker**: Required for containerization
  - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your OS
  - Verify the installation by running `docker run hello-world`

- **☁️ AWS CLI**: Install and configure with your credentials:
  ```bash
  aws configure  # You'll need access key, secret key, default region (us-east-1 recommended)
  ```

- **📦 Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm installed
  ```bash
  node --version  # Should be >= 14
  npm --version
  ```

- **🏗️ AWS CDK**: Install globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  cdk --version  # Verify installation
  ```

- **📋 CDK Dependencies**: From the `cdk` directory, install necessary packages:
  ```bash
  cd cdk
  npm install
  ```

## 📥 Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-underwriting-workbench-demo/
cd sample-genai-underwriting-workbench-demo
```

## ⚙️ Bootstrap and Deploy the CDK Stack

1. If necessary, bootstrap your AWS environment (required once per account/region):
```bash
cd cdk
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION  # Replace with your AWS account number and region
```

3. Deploy the stack:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

This process will:
- Create all necessary AWS resources (Lambda functions, Load Balancers, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, etc.)
- Deploy backend services and the frontend application
- Output API endpoints and frontend URLs once complete

**Note**: Ensure your AWS account has appropriate permissions to create and manage these resources, including:
- Lambda function creation and management
- DynamoDB table creation
- S3 bucket management
- IAM role and policy management
- CloudFormation full access



# 🏗️ Technical Overview

![underwriter analysis screenshot](assets/workflow-diagram.png)

## 🔄 Demo Workflow

This demo streamlines the underwriting process through a powerful AI-driven workflow, which can be broken down into four key stages:

1. **Ingest**: Incoming documents are uploaded to S3.
2. **Classify**: Documents are then classified to determine their type (e.g., application, medical report, financial statement). This ensures the correct processing path and relevant extraction models are applied.
3. **Extract**: Key information and data points are extracted from the classified documents. This includes details like applicant information, medical history, financial data, and other relevant underwriting criteria.
4. **Analyze**: The extracted data is then analyzed by advanced AI models to identify potential risks, discrepancies, and generate comprehensive underwriting insights. This stage highlights critical information and suggests recommendations.
5. **Act**: Underwriters can then interact with the analyzed data through a chat interface, review insights, and make informed decisions, leveraging the AI-generated analysis to accelerate their workflow.

## 🧩 Project Components

![underwriter analysis screenshot](assets/architecture.png)

The project consists of three main components:

- **Backend**: A serverless backend built with AWS Lambda functions and orchestrated by AWS Step Functions. It leverages Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic's Claude models for intelligent document processing.
  - **API Gateway (api-handler Lambda)**: Handles all API requests, including document uploads (via presigned S3 URLs), retrieving job statuses, and fetching analysis results.
  - **Document Extraction (bedrock-extract Lambda)**: Triggered by new document uploads to S3. It converts PDF documents to images, extracts key-value information from each page using Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3 model, classifies pages, and stores the raw extracted data.
  - **Document Analysis (analyze Lambda)**: Processes the extracted data from the `bedrock-extract` function. It uses Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model to perform comprehensive underwriting analysis, identifying risks, discrepancies, and generating final recommendations.
  - **Agentic Actions (act Lambda)**: Uses the [Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/) to perform agentic actions, such as auto declining or requesting additional documentation. 
  - **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions coordinate the flow between the document upload, extraction, and analysis steps, ensuring a robust and scalable workflow.
  - **Data Storage**: DynamoDB is used to store job metadata, extracted data, and the final analysis results, while S3 is used for raw document storage.

- **Frontend**: A React application (powered by Vite) that provides:
  - Document upload interface with progress tracking
  - Visual representation of extracted information
  - Interactive chat interface for querying document contents
  - Organized display of underwriting insights
  - Seamless document reprocessing capabilities

- **Infrastructure**: Deployed via AWS CDK, which automates the provisioning and management of all cloud resources.

## 💻 Development Setup

The frontend can be run locally for development and testing. Follow these steps:

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Create an `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following content:
   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=http://{CloudFront URL of deployed application}
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
